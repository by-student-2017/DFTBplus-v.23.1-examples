We used tiorg-0-1 (51) (for TiO2-C3N4 system) and matsci-0-3 (72) (for Si-Ti-O systems) parameter sets. 

The structures were optimized until forces were below 1e-3 eV/Angstrom. An electronic temperature of 300 K was used to improve convergence.

DFTB molecular dynamics (MD) was performed with a time step of 2 fs. The temperature of an NVT ensemble was controlled by a Berendsen thermostat with a 50 fs time constant. MD calculations were performed at the Gamma point.
